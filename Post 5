Learned more CSS with BYOL and began playing with Github desktop and learning revision systems. I am starting to have lots of fun putting thing together and making these connections. To start padding my portfolio I think I want to reach out to ham radio operators and their ancient looking websites and offering to modernize and revamp whats already there. I thought I could start by trading for ham radio gear as I also study for my general (hoping to test on Saturday). If there is a good amount of interest in site revamps I may charge a small fee but for now I want to focus on flexing the skills Iâ€™m learning. Start-ups and Non-profits are also on my radar for breaking in to the front end dev world.
