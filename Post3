Going to Keep this one brief. I got some work done on my first website. Just a personal website for showcasing projects and hobbies. I used my previous experience with Fusion360 to draw up a quick logo as I'm still learning Inkscape/gimp. It was quicker to get the geometric shape by drawing a DXF and converting it in Inkscape. Yesterday I also finished the basic CSS course on FreeCodeCamp.com. It was really easy after finishing the tutorial by BYOL.
