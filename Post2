Yesterday I finished a 4 hour collection of videos from the creator ‘Bring Your Own Laptop’. The playlist covered the basics of HTML and CSS including building a simple but elegant website for a restaurant. I really liked this course. So much that I think I may subscribe for a month to finish the course. The last boot-camp I looked into cost $8900 so this $12/month subscription(i don’t imagine requiring more than a month to finish the course) seems exceedingly fair. Besides the cost, this course didn’t start in some proprietary IDE, we learned how to go through VS code to make something real including hosting and publishing. It seems that having something tangible at the end reallyyyyyyy makes a difference in keeping me on track. I’m still picking away at Freecodecamp.com. It seems a little simple now going through BYOL’s course but it comes highly recommended. I Really like the idea of working with a non-profit at the end of their course too. Any sort of real world experience goes a long way. Today I want to work through some more HTML and CSS videos from YouTube to reinforce the ideas but I am beginning to feeling confident.
