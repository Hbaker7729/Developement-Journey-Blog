Been busy with life and such. My journey seems to be accelerating. I haven't updated this blog in a few days between work and digging into new courses. I signed up for the BYOL course and plan to finish the html/css this week. Also, W3schools. If you're reading this, you've probably heard of the site and WOW I fins myself learning very quickly on their site. It really give me motivation and the curiousity to explore more languages after developing the skills I need to find a good job first. Baby steps.
