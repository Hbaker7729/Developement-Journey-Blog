So it seems this has evolved into a weekly update blog. I have been working through BYOL but at a slower pace. I discovered roadmaps.sh and it was exactly what I was looking for. Being able to see everything represented visually is really helping me put thing together. It also takes me back to basics that I thought I had a good grip on but evidently didn’t fully understand. Right now I’m taking a break from a page on HTTP3 and QUIC. The roadmap built things up as they were built in the first place. Working my way up from HTTP 0.9 and working through 10, 1.1, 2, and now 3 and why things needed to be changed and upgraded helped my mind wrap around the concept as a whole. I will highly recommend this to anyone I hear talking about a curiosity in coding. Some may not think it wise to jump from course to course, methods to method but as someone with ADHD, attacking these sorts of problems from all sides/perspectives helps me develop a full understanding of a topic. Now, back to work!
